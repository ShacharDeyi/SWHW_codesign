1. attached the previous script from HW1, the commands from the example in the project.pdf and my repository structure.
	can you write me a script based on those that run a chosen as an argument benchmark and put results such as output, report and flamegraph in the correct directory?
- i want to create a new file each time not to add to an old one from the previous run. how to do so?

2.im running on qemu and python env. im trying to use perf record -F 999 -g -- python3-dbg -m script and in my script i want to compile with cython. 
	please help me understand what i need to do in order to use cython, what i need to install, what commands to use and so on

3. this is unpack_sequence benchmark from pyperformance. we want to use cython to accelatre the performance. 
	we only want to use it in unpacking loop but keep the runner class logic in python. could you help us convert it?

4. how can i download orjson into my venv-dbg?

5. inserted perf command. can you add the ability to see average stats using perf?

6. how is orjson also fully compatible with json but also returns bytes instead of strings?

7. we know pyperf is calibrating its loops based on a first run. how would you say that our costum benchmark ran more loops and it affects its stats?

8. how to calculate improvement percentage?

9. why flamegraphs dont show python functions?

10. i create a new evn: python3-dbg -m venv venv-dbg source venv-dbg/bin/activate 
	everytime i want to run perf stat -r 10 -e task-clock,context-switches,page-faults,cache-references,cache-misses,cycles,instructions
	\ python3-dbg -m pyperformance run --bench json_dumps_ujson which is a custom benchmark that uses ujson library. 
	i get this messege that says ujson is not installed here /root/pyperformance/venv/cpython3.10-*/bin/python and its a different 
	cpython3.10 path each time. unless i do /root/pyperformance/venv/cpython3.10-*/bin/python -m pip install ujson manually with the full 
	path it provides it wont work. how can i avoid doingit manually?

11. i want to put garbage information in the cache. can you write me a script that does it?
- how to find cache size?

12. https://pyperformance.readthedocs.io/custom_benchmarks.html based on this, help me add my benchmark unpack_sequence_opt

13. how to clone my git repo into my qemu?

14. help us rephrase these sentences to fit a presentation

15. attached part of the unpacking_sequence benchmark. how is this assignment working? is the unpacking happening simultaneously or one after the other?
	is there a way to make it simultaneous if it's not like that right now?

16. We want to create a specific hardware unit that deals with lists/tuples and transfers them into arrays (for acceleration of the unpacking_sequence benchmark).
	how would you measure a speedup of something like that?

17. help us to create a block diagram of the new hardware unit so we could put it in a txt file. make it more precise to the following flow (added flow)
	
18. can you compare the implementation of dumps in ujson, json and orjson. show me the resources as well.

19. can you make me ascii art of your concept of ai?
	answer:
	Here’s a try — a little ASCII art that represents my concept of AI: a "mind" made of circuits, 
	branching out like neurons but still structured and digital.
